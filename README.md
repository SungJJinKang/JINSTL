Homemade STL library for studying, [DoomsEngine](https://github.com/SungJJinKang/DoomsEngine)       

## Goal

- Make Homemade STL Library          
- Write simple and readable code        
- Global Allocator. ( Passing allocator as template argument isn't required, Global variable allocator is uesed )
